### Available Endpoints:
```

GET /api/reviews                 -> Returns all reviews with populated user/product/order data
GET /api/analytics               -> Returns analytics dashboard data
GET /api/v1/allusers            -> Same as /api/allusers (frontend compatibility)
GET /api/v1/reviews             -> Same as /api/reviews (frontend compatibility)  
GET /api/v1/analytics           -> Same as /api/analytics (frontend compatibility)
```

### Analytics Data Includes:
- Total users count
- Total orders count  
- Total reviews count
